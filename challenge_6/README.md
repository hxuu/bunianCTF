## BunianCTF 6th Challenge

### Description

This one is a boot2root machine! Your task is to:

1. Find the user flag.
2. Find the root flag.

### How to run the VM

1. Install Virtualbox
2. Download the .ova file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sWCreFxU8b0m3W3eXk7DcjoWDSWlN_m3/view?usp=sharing)
3. Open Virtualbox and import the .ova file

> [!TIP]
> The VM uses host-only networking mode to be reachable from the host via an interface like tun0.
> Make sure you configure that too. Also, to figure out the IP of the VM, you can just swipe the network using Nmap.

Enjoy :)
